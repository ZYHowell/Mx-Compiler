# Mx-Compiler
This is my solution for MS208 homework in ACM class, a compiler of Mx* language which is alike C++ and Java. The front end of the compiler implements ANTLR4. 

*A handmade compiler is a programmer's romance, especially when he has a CPU almost able to run it*

*What? only 10,000 lines can complete it? Even my foolish CPU contains more codes!*
